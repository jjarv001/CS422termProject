## Description/Intro
The intention of this project/experiment is to identify input variables that have a significant effect on the success/failure of plants and use determine an appropriate machine learning model to be able to predict a success/failure outcome based on those input variables. 

The data utilized for the initial setup and analysis of this project can be found at: [(https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81931456-1267-4bbc-8b9f-a436d8f84516)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gorororororo23/plant-growth-data-classification/code
) and is also available in this repository as a .csv file.


## Running the Program

This program is structured as a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb). As such there are multiple, many in fact, cells throughout this program. In order for the program to function correctly it should be supplied a .csv file with identical labels and variables; the individual cells in this program must also be executed sequentially for proper function.

This program is designed to display (within the program) important features/metrics that play a role in plant success/failure, as well as provide statistics on variables and models tested.

Finally, below you will find a Table of Contents with brief descriptions highlighting areas of interest and significant points in the process. Throughout the program, you will find "Notes" at the bottom of each section listed below that list several "takeaways" from that particular section.
