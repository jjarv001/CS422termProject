## Description/Intro
The intention of this project/experiment is to identify input variables that have a significant effect on the success/failure of plants and use determine an appropriate machine learning model to be able to predict a success/failure outcome based on those input variables. 

The data utilized for the initial setup and analysis of this project can be found at: [(https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81931456-1267-4bbc-8b9f-a436d8f84516)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gorororororo23/plant-growth-data-classification/code
) and is also available in this repository as a .csv file.


## Running the Program

This program is structured as a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb). As such there are multiple, many in fact, cells throughout this program. In order for the program to function correctly it should be supplied a .csv file with identical labels and variables; the individual cells in this program must also be executed sequentially for proper function.

This program is designed to display (within the program) important features/metrics that play a role in plant success/failure, as well as provide statistics on variables and models tested.

Finally, below you will find a Table of Contents with brief descriptions highlighting areas of interest and significant points in the process. Throughout the program, you will find "Notes" at the bottom of each section listed below that list several "takeaways" from that particular section.


## Table of Contents

* Setup and Initial Data View
In this section the user may wish to modify the input file (.csv) if they are utilizing a different dataset (reminder: the structure of the .csv must   have the same labels).
  This section also checks for missing/duplicate values, informs the user of the data types, and provides a basic visualization of the data.


* Visualizing the Data
  This section provides a visualization of each individual variable's distribution in association with the sample set. If using the .csv provided, the initial dataset should be relatively evenly distributed for each categorical and quantitative variable.


* Comparing Individual Variables and Success/Failure
